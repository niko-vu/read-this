## Description

A markdown file generator that utilizes npm inquirer 8.2.4, node.js, and javascript.

I found the motivation to finish this project because I knew that I could pull something like this off despite me struggling in class recently and not being able to stay as focused as usual. I wanted to prove to myself that I could take this starter code and make it functional. As with many of my projects, I built this one to solidify the confidence I have in my abilities to code and to practice my skills so that I can utilize them and this experience in later situations and projects. I was able to take the starter code and mold it into my own code, learning from the process of doing so.

## Installation

Clone the repository and discard the example files you don't need (niko-vu.json and generatedREADME.md--though you can choose to keep the latter because it will just be replaced with your copy after you generate your own markdown file).

## Usage

1. Open index.js in the integrated terminal
2. Type node index.js into the terminal
3. Answer the questions/prompts
4. Your generatedREADME.md should be updated and you can rename the file as you so choose and extract it

The deployed application should look something like this:

## Credits

* I was assisted by Patrick Lake who was tutoring me and helping me with my writeToFile(data) function.

* I referenced this [Professional README Guide tutorial](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) for the structure of my README and the generateMarkdown.js file I modified.

* I did not author the starter code and I cloned it from the repository, [potential-enigma]([https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma)). This starter code can be found throughout my generateMarkdown.js and index.js files.

* I referenced this [Node.js tutorial](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/writing-files-with-nodejs/) when writing my functions.

* This all requires npm inquirer 8.2.4
